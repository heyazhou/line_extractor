# line_extractor
---
# I have to say
This is a simple implement to extract lines from 2d laser points. By the way, the code is simple but it works. 

# Result

# How to Use
It's easy to compile the whole package if your enviroment is Ubuntu16.04 + ROS Kinetic, but it's ok to use the kernel algorithm in 
line_extractor.cpp without ROS. You have to write Makefile or CMakeLists.txt by yourself.

Good Luck!!
